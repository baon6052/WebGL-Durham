------------ Description ------------

What you will hopefully see is the Durham Cathedrale next to the river.
Although there are no key/mouse navigation the model is in an orbit, allowing you
to view everything entirely. The main lighting technique applied is Phong Lighting which gives
an interestingly beautiful effect to the model. The model and textures were made in Blender
and are redered via webgl. Models and textures can be viewed in the Blender folder.
